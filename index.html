<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>My TwitchTV-App runs in the background and silently updates the ‘Currently Playing’ section on your Twitch Streams without you needing to manually change it. It works by compairing running processes with a database made by myself which will resolve process names into a format the Twitch Games database can understand. This application will require Channel Editor permissions on your account in order to change your Stream Title/Game.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Download the latest release <a href="https://github.com/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App/releases/latest">here</a> and continue to Install the program like you usually would. From there it’s as easy as logging into Twitch and leaving the Application to Idle in the background.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>This application is newly developed and will most likely have a few undiscovered bugs. If you happen to find any please submit more information about it <a href="https://github.com/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App/issues/new">here</a>.</p>

<p>This biggest downfall of this application is the custom database. I have to manually input the process name and the Full Game name in order for this application to correctly work. If your game is not being detected please submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App/issues/new">here</a> with the games name and it’s process.</p>

<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
<p>A special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/arylatt">Andy</a> who would help fix my code when I couldn’t figure it out. This application wouldn’t be available if it wasn’t for him.</p>
