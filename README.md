# TwitchTV-App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App)
## Concept
My idea is to have this application hook into running processes and compare them to a custom games database. If a game is found running, the users 
Twitch account will be updated to match the game using the [Twitch API.](https://dev.twitch.tv/)

## Status
It's moderately stable with its lack of features.
