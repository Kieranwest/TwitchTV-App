# TwitchTV-App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kieranwest/TwitchTV-App)

## Overview
My TwitchTV-App runs in the background and silently updates the 'Currently Playing' section on your Twitch Streams without you needing to manually change it. It works by compairing running processes with a database made by myself which will resolve process names into a format the Twitch Games database can understand. This application will require Channel Editor permissions on your account in order to change your Stream Title/Game.

Twitch account will be updated to match the game using the [Twitch API.](https://dev.twitch.tv/)
