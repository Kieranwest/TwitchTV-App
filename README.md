# TwitchTV-App
## Concept
My idea is to have this applciation hook into running processes and compare them to a custom games database. If a game is found running, the users 
Twitch account will be updated to match the game using the [Twitch API.](https://dev.twitch.tv/)

## Status
It doesn't fucking work
